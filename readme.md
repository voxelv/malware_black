# Malware Black

## Main Premise
You control a cyborg army and must keep the members trained and repaired for their missions.
Like AC4: Black Flag's "Kenway's Fleet" minigame.

* Primarily GUI-based interaction for each member of the army. We don't actually see their battles.
* Upgrades/Repairs for:
    * Armor
    * Shields
    * Cyborg prosthetics
    * Software (prevents the dreaded `Malware Black` from affecting cyborg prosthetics)

## Prosthetics
Strictly limited to:
* Hands
* Arms
* Eyes
* Torso
* Legs
* Feet

## Missions
Some mission types might include (prosthetics in parenthesis increase effectiveness of army member at that mission type):
* Attack/Defend (Arms, Torso, Legs) 
    * Idea: "Strong Core"
* Escort/Ambush (Hands, Eyes, Feet) 
    * Idea: "Manage VIP/Hostage"
* Surveillance/Counter-Intelligence (Eyes, Legs, Feet) 
    * Idea: "Scout and Run"
* Assassinate/Bodyguard (Hands, Arms, Eyes)
    * Idea: "Snipe and Manage VIP"
* Guard/Infiltrate (Hands, Torso, Feet)
    * Idea: "Office-Building Operations"
* Search-And-Destroy/Construct-Outposts (Torso, Legs, Feet)
    * Idea: "Heavy-Lifting"
    

## Malware Black
* The enemy of your cyborg army
* It attacks the cyborg prosthetics of the army members
* Software versions of cyborg prosthetics can be kept up to date to combat the `Malware Black`
* Represented by some kind of meter which will update periodically based on army members' sent on missions.

### Software versions
For each cyborg prosthetic type (e.g. Hand, Arm, Eye, Torso, Legs, Feet), a new software version comes out periodically.
The prosthetics must be kept up to date to keep them from being compromised.

## Stretch Goals
* Technology tree
    * Increase healing speed
    * Software Patch Quality
